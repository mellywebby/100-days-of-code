# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: October 3, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Learned about variables and data types in Python.

**Thoughts:** I like the simplicity of Python syntax so far. Learning how to flip the switch between coding in C and coding in Python should be interesting. I am looking forward to learning about loops and conditional statements in Python.

**Link to work:** None for today!

### Day 2: October 4, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Learned about lists and reading in information from a file in Python.

**Thoughts:** It's amazing how easy it is to read in data from a file in Python and create a list that contains the data. I'm already starting to see why it's widely used for data analysis. I learned how to use the reader and list command, but I would like to learn more about how they actually work. I'll do that tomorrow.

**Link to work:** None for today!

### Day 3: October 5, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Practiced working with variables and data types to get more familiar with the syntax. I learned append() for lists, for loops, and how to use range().

**Thoughts:** I think I'm getting better at taking concise notes. At first, I was writing almost everything down, but understanding the information and writing practice codes are more effective than writing a book.

### Day 4: October 6, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Practiced working with lists and for loops. Wrote a nested for loop in Python for the first time.

**Thoughts:** Slowly but surely warming up to Python syntax. Honestly, today's hour wasn't very productive considering I was already half-asleep at the start of the hour. I was making a lot of silly mistakes. I'm going to start coding in the mornings/afternoons as frequently as possible from here on out.

### Day 5: October 7, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Focused on conditional statements. Learned Python syntax for if statements and logical operators.

**Thoughts:** I used to find it so overwhelming that software engineers were expected to know so many different programming languages, but seeing now how the fundamental ideas are the same between C and Python (so far), the idea of knowing multiple programming languages seems more attainable. I am looking forward to setting up VS Code to run Python code, finishing up conditional statements, and learning about dictionaries tomorrow.

### Day 6: October 8, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Configured VS Code to run Python (after a bit of a struggle), finished up conditional statements, and started learning about dictionaries.

**Thoughts:** First of all, dictionaries are super cool. Having a uniquely defined index is already proving to be very useful in the practice problems that I completed today. Secondly, I acknowledge that I still have a whole lot to learn, but right now I am focused on enjoying the process. I'm feeling really good about this today.

### Day 7: October 9, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked with a CSV file that contained the top 100 names given to newborns in Scotland from 1974 to 2019. I practiced opening the file and creating a dictionary with year as the indexes and the most popular boy name as the values. I also learned how to use the in operator to populate a dictionary.

**Thoughts:** Downloading a real data set and using what I've learned in the past week to extract information was exhilarating. It was my first time creating a meaningful python program outside of the course. 

### Day 8: October 10, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Learned how to use a dictionary to count the frequencies in a data set and completed related practice problems. I also learned the syntax for defining and calling a function.

**Thoughts:** Today I found myself regularly glancing at upcoming topics in the course and feeling like I was behind. This led me to spend more time working through the course than I had originally planned which took time away from other things that I needed to get done today. During my lunch break, I started reading Atomic Habits by James Clear which reminded me that a little progress everyday will surely lead me to my goals. It's nice knowing that the next time that I feel like this, whether it's on day 10 or day 80, I can look back at this log and remind myself of just how far I have come.

### Day 9: October 11, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Practiced defining and calling functions to solve various problems.

**Thoughts:** I enjoy comparing my code to the provided solutions because I am able to see other (sometimes more simpler) ways of completing the same problem. From that I'm learning to see problems from different points of view.

### Day 10: October 12, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Learned a bit more about functions. Today I was introduced to default arguments, returning multiple values from a function, and consequently, tuples. I also read the documentation for open() and round().

**Thoughts:** We have officially entered double-digit days! Woo-hoo! I think the next milestone I'll celebrate is completing day 25. Reading the documentation for open() after learning about default arguments helped me solidify the concept. Returning multiple values from a function isn't possible (at least not directly) in C, so that's another way in which the two languages differ. In other news, I came up with an idea for a C program that I can work on in addition to learning Python. I'll share more about it tomorrow.

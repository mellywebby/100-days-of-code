# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: October 3, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Learned about variables and data types in Python.

**Thoughts:** I like the simplicity of Python syntax so far. Learning how to flip the switch between coding in C and coding in Python should be interesting. I am looking forward to learning about loops and conditional statements in Python.

**Link to work:** None for today!

### Day 2: October 4, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Learned about lists and reading in information from a file in Python.

**Thoughts:** It's amazing how easy it is to read in data from a file in Python and create a list that contains the data. I'm already starting to see why it's widely used for data analysis. I learned how to use the reader and list command, but I would like to learn more about how they actually work. I'll do that tomorrow.

**Link to work:** None for today!

### Day 3: October 5, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Practiced working with variables and data types to get more familiar with the syntax. I learned append() for lists, for loops, and how to use range().

**Thoughts:** I think I'm getting better at taking concise notes. At first, I was writing almost everything down, but understanding the information and writing practice codes are more effective than writing a book.

### Day 4: October 6, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Practiced working with lists and for loops. Wrote a nested for loop in Python for the first time.

**Thoughts:** Slowly but surely warming up to Python syntax. Honestly, today's hour wasn't very productive considering I was already half-asleep at the start of the hour. I was making a lot of silly mistakes. I'm going to start coding in the mornings/afternoons as frequently as possible from here on out.

### Day 5: October 7, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Focused on conditional statements. Learned Python syntax for if statements and logical operators.

**Thoughts:** I used to find it so overwhelming that software engineers were expected to know so many different programming languages, but seeing now how the fundamental ideas are the same between C and Python (so far), the idea of knowing multiple programming languages seems more attainable. I am looking forward to setting up VS Code to run Python code,finishing up conditional statements, and learning about dictionaries tomorrow.

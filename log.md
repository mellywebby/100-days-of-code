# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: October 3, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Learned about variables and data types in Python.

**Thoughts:** I like the simplicity of Python syntax so far. Learning how to flip the switch between coding in C and coding in Python should be interesting. I am looking forward to learning about loops and conditional statements in Python.

**Link to work:** None for today!

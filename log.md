# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: October 3, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Learned about variables and data types in Python.

**Thoughts:** I like the simplicity of Python syntax so far. Learning how to flip the switch between coding in C and coding in Python should be interesting. I am looking forward to learning about loops and conditional statements in Python.

**Link to work:** None for today!

### Day 2: October 4, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Learned about lists and reading in information from a file in Python.

**Thoughts:** It's amazing how easy it is to read in data from a file in Python and create a list that contains the data. I'm already starting to see why it's widely used for data analysis. I learned how to use the reader and list command, but I would like to learn more about how they actually work. I'll do that tomorrow.

**Link to work:** None for today!

### Day 3: October 5, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Practiced working with variables and data types to get more familiar with the syntax. I learned append() for lists, for loops, and how to use range().

**Thoughts:** I think I'm getting better at taking concise notes. At first, I was writing almost everything down, but understanding the information and writing practice codes are more effective than writing a book.

### Day 4: October 6, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Practiced working with lists and for loops. Wrote a nested for loop in Python for the first time.

**Thoughts:** Slowly but surely warming up to Python syntax. Honestly, today's hour wasn't very productive considering I was already half-asleep at the start of the hour. I was making a lot of silly mistakes. I'm going to start coding in the mornings/afternoons as frequently as possible from here on out.

### Day 5: October 7, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Focused on conditional statements. Learned Python syntax for if statements and logical operators.

**Thoughts:** I used to find it so overwhelming that software engineers were expected to know so many different programming languages, but seeing now how the fundamental ideas are the same between C and Python (so far), the idea of knowing multiple programming languages seems more attainable. I am looking forward to setting up VS Code to run Python code, finishing up conditional statements, and learning about dictionaries tomorrow.

### Day 6: October 8, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Configured VS Code to run Python (after a bit of a struggle), finished up conditional statements, and started learning about dictionaries.

**Thoughts:** First of all, dictionaries are super cool. Having a uniquely defined index is already proving to be very useful in the practice problems that I completed today. Secondly, I acknowledge that I still have a whole lot to learn, but right now I am focused on enjoying the process. I'm feeling really good about this today.

### Day 7: October 9, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked with a CSV file that contained the top 100 names given to newborns in Scotland from 1974 to 2019. I practiced opening the file and creating a dictionary with year as the indexes and the most popular boy name as the values. I also learned how to use the in operator to populate a dictionary.

**Thoughts:** Downloading a real data set and using what I've learned in the past week to extract information was exhilarating. It was my first time creating a meaningful python program outside of the course. 

### Day 8: October 10, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Learned how to use a dictionary to count the frequencies in a data set and completed related practice problems. I also learned the syntax for defining and calling a function.

**Thoughts:** Today I found myself regularly glancing at upcoming topics in the course and feeling like I was behind. This led me to spend more time working through the course than I had originally planned which took time away from other things that I needed to get done today. During my lunch break, I started reading Atomic Habits by James Clear which reminded me that a little progress everyday will surely lead me to my goals. It's nice knowing that the next time that I feel like this, whether it's on day 10 or day 80, I can look back at this log and remind myself of just how far I have come.

### Day 9: October 11, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Practiced defining and calling functions to solve various problems.

**Thoughts:** I enjoy comparing my code to the provided solutions because I am able to see other (sometimes more simpler) ways of completing the same problem. From that I'm learning to see problems from different points of view.

### Day 10: October 12, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Learned a bit more about functions. Today I was introduced to default arguments, returning multiple values from a function, and consequently, tuples. I also read the documentation for open() and round().

**Thoughts:** We have officially entered double-digit days! Woo-hoo! I think the next milestone I'll celebrate is completing day 25. Reading the documentation for open() after learning about default arguments helped me solidify the concept. Returning multiple values from a function isn't possible (at least not directly) in C, so that's another way in which the two languages differ. In other news, I came up with an idea for a C program that I can work on in addition to learning Python. I'll share more about it tomorrow.

### Day 11: October 13, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished up functions by reviewing function scope and spent a bit of time working on coding problems to reinforce what I've learned the past few days. Today I learned that functions without a return statement return a None value.

**Thoughts:** It felt nice to finish learning about functions. I plan on reviewing the concepts I've learned so far by exploring code as it comes to me in VS Code tomorrow. The C project I mentioned yesterday is in the planning phase. When it's complete, it will be a budgeting console application that will allow the user to create, read, update, and delete monthly budgets. I had difficulty falling asleep the other night because I kept exploring different ideas I had for the project, so you could say that I'm pretty excited about it. I'll provide a link to the repo once I get it up and running.

### Day 12: October 14, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started learning the basics of Jupyter Notebook: creating and running cells, command mode vs edit mode, and some keyboard shortcuts.

**Thoughts:** I've read that Jupyter Notebook is a great tool for data visualization, so I'm certainly looking forward to learning more about its capabilities. Doing so is listed as one of my goals for this 100 day challenge, so only time will tell what I'll be able to accomplish.

### Day 13: October 15, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved practice problems involving lists.

**Thoughts:** I wasn't aware that you could specify an increment between each index when list slicing. Learning that allowed me to simplify my code as I worked through problems today. Python has a lot of very useful built-in functions.

### Day 14: October 16, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Learned about state and hidden state in Jupyter Notebook, read up on markdown syntax, and created some markdown cells.

**Thoughts:** I also did some more planning for my C project, EachCent. I really want to make sure that I plan out the structure of the project well enough so new features can be implemented with ease. 

### Day 15: October 17, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Installed Jupyter Notebook and learned a bit more about it.

**Thoughts:** I was taken aback when I launched Jupyter Notebook and saw all of my personal computer files there. After some googling, I realized that I just had to launch the notebook from a different folder. I didn't complete the first course today like I had originally planned, so I'm feeling a little bit disapointed.

### Day 16: October 18, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started working on a guided project using Jupyter Notebook. The project is to analyze Apple Store and Google Play Store data to determine the types of apps that generate the most ad revenue.

**Thoughts:** It feels great to be working with thousands of rows of data. I'm starting to find large data sets less intimidating as I progress through this course. I am completing the Data Analyst in Python path on Dataquest. I failed to mentioned this earlier. Better late than never.

### Day 17: October 19, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Did more planning for EachCent project and made initial commit. Continued to work on guided project by deleting incorrect data and identifying duplicate entries.

**Thoughts:** I'm super happy to have my EachCent repo up and running on GitHub. I only typed up the structs that the program will use, but it still feels great to have material evidence of all of the brainstorming that I've been doing over the past few days.

**Link to work:** [EachCent](https://github.com/mellywebby/EachCent/commit/ba3c6d325a7e451f9a46b2b5a141f20ba677bd0a)

### Day 18: October 20, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished a guided project and read an informational article about how to format Jupyter Notebooks.

**Thoughts:** Overall, I enjoyed completing my first guided project. I learned a few new functions like replace() and ord(). The latter was used to identify the apps that were in English, since those were the apps that we were interested in learning more about.

### Day 19: October 21, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started my second course, *Python for Data Science: Intermediate*, by learning about data cleaning. More specifically, I learned about the method title(), used replace() a bit more, and developed an understanding of tracebacks and how to handle errors while cleaning data.

**Thoughts:** I know that data analysts spend more time cleaning data than on analyzing data, so data cleaning is a very important skill for me to acquire. I also recognize that cleaning data incorrectly can lead to terrible outcomes, so I'm very excited to learn more about this particular topic.

### Day 20: October 22, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Used the split() method to convert a date range to calculate the average date. I learned that strings and lists are similar in Python, so we can use indexing and slicing on strings just as we have on lists.

**Thoughts:** I'm feeling alright. Not much to say today.

### Day 21: October 23, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Learned and practiced using format() and items().

**Thoughts:** I like that the format() method lets us use named arguments because that makes the code more readable. 

### Day 22: October 24, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started learning about how classes and objects are handled in Python.

**Thoughts:** I remember learning about classes and objects when I learned Java a while back, but I don't really remember any of the syntax. I do remember that I enjoyed working with objects, so I'm looking forward to doing the same in Python. I read that data analyst rarely create classes, but I'm still excited to learn more about how they work because I want to use Python outside of data analytics to tackle passion projects.
